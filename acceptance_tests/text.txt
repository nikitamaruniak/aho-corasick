Python (programming language)

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Crea
ted by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy e
mphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its l
anguage constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write cl
ear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[28]

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programm
ing paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming
. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its compre
hensive standard library.[29]

Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Pytho
n 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garb
age collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0, releas
ed in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward
-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.

The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on January
 1, 2020 (first planned for 2015) after which security patches and other improve
ments will not be released for it.[30][31] With Python 2's end-of-life, only Pyt
hon 3.5.x[32] and later are supported.

Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community
 of programmers develops and maintains CPython, an open source[33] reference imp
lementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages 
and directs resources for Python and CPython development.
